# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This project was my introduction to creating a webpage. The process of creating this study guide has helped me get familiar with many related programs such as GitHub, Git Bash, and Visual Studio Code. I have also gotten familiar with different types of languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was proud to have completed the Prework Study Guide Webpage. I was not fimiliar with any aspect of building a web application until I completed this project.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage has many uses and benefits. The design and layout is simple and easy to navigate. The guide covers four major topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each topic is broken down and categorized to include main points and key information. Also, the DevTools console in the Google Chrome web browser can be utilized to see an example of JavaScript running. When the webpage is refreshed, the DevTools console will display the four main topics outlined in the guide and choose one at random for the user to study.
